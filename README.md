# Heb12 Bible App
A Linux program for reading the Bible.

This application currently uses [this API](http://labs.bible.org/api_web_service), and an offline KJV version. It might support more in the future.

If you would like to try out a prerelease version for Linux (without automatic updates) you can get it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bSoHc1mAjkGA6cyjO7YDcD8BtOdTxnuh?usp=sharing).

## Installation
To install the program for editing, run these commands:
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/masterofthetiger/heb12
$ cd heb12
$ yarn install && yarn start
</pre>

Packages for easy installation will be available upon the release of the first version. 

## Contributing
Feel free to make changes to the design, scripts, and even the fundamental code to the program, as it is still in heavy development, and submit a pull request. However, please make sure the following work before submitting your request.
- The API request
- The rendering of the scripture
- The selecting of verses
If any of those do not work, then it will not be accepted without changes.
