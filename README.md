# bible-electron
An Electron app for reading the Bible.

This application currently uses [this API](http://labs.bible.org/api_web_service). It only supports NET, but soon this app will likely also include this [KJV API](http://bible-api.com) as well. 

## Installation
To install the program for editing, run these commands:
<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/masterofthetiger/bible-electron
$ cd bible-electron
$ npm install && npm start
</pre>

Packages for easy installation will be available upon the release of the first version. 

## Contributing
Feel free to make changes to the design, scripts, and even the fundamental code to the program, as it is still in heavy development, and submit a pull request. However, please make sure the following work before submitting your request.
- The API request
- The rendering of the scripture
- The selecting of verses
If any of those do not work, then it will not be accepted without changes.
